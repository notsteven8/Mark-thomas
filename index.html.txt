<h2>Welcome to my personal portfolio</h2>
<p>Hi, I'm Mark Thomas. I'm a 50-year-old man who has experienced the ups and downs of life, including personal struggles and growth. This portfolio represents my journey and the lessons I've learned along the way.</p>

<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>I'm a man who's been through a lot. I went through a divorce after a difficult period of betrayal, and I'm here to share my story. I made mistakes in my personal life, notably cheating with Jacqui, which ended up costing me my marriage. It was a painful experience, but it led to self-reflection and change. While my journey has been far from perfect, I’ve grown and learned valuable lessons that have shaped me into who I am today.</p>
<p>At 50, I’m focused on personal growth, career progress, and rebuilding relationships. Life may not always go as planned, but I've learned the importance of honesty, integrity, and learning from mistakes.</p>
